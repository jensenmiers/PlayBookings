AI Development Strategy
Code Generation Approach
Component-First Development: Generate reusable UI components with shadcn/ui
Schema-Driven: Use database schema to generate TypeScript types automatically
API-First: Generate API routes and client-side hooks from OpenAPI specs
Testing Integration: Generate unit and integration tests alongside features
Recommended AI Tools Integration
GitHub Copilot: For component and function generation
Cursor: For context-aware refactoring and feature completion
Supabase CLI: For automated migrations and type generation
shadcn/ui CLI: For consistent component scaffolding
Quality Assurance
Generate comprehensive TypeScript types from Supabase schema
Implement error boundaries and loading states for all async operations
Create responsive design tests for mobile and desktop viewports
Setup automated testing for critical booking and payment flows
Technical Milestones
Stage 1: Core authentication and basic venue profiles working
Stage 2: Booking system with conflict detection operational
Stage 3: Insurance workflow and basic payments integrated
Stage 4: Full messaging and notification system complete
Stage 5: Admin dashboard and audit trails fully functional
This implementation plan is designed to leverage AI code generation effectively while maintaining code quality and system reliability. Each phase builds upon the previous one, ensuring we have a functional MVP at each milestone.
